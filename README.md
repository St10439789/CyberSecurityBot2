# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

This C# console-based chatbot is designed to educate users about common cybersecurity topics and best practices. It provides helpful guidance using keyword recognition, random responses, sentiment-aware replies, memory recall, and follow-up conversations ‚Äî all within a friendly and interactive environment.

Features

Keyword Recognition
The bot identifies key cybersecurity terms (e.g., `password`, `scam`, `phishing`, `privacy`) and provides useful, topic-specific tips.

 Random Responses
Some topics (like `phishing`) return a random helpful tip to keep the conversation dynamic and engaging.

 Natural Conversation Flow
The chatbot maintains a `currentTopic` to track the conversation. Users can ask for "more" information about a topic without repeating the question.

 üß† Memory & Recall
- Stores the user's name to personalize greetings.
- Remembers interests (e.g., "I'm interested in privacy") and refers back to them in future responses.

Sentiment Detection
Detects simple emotional keywords like:
- worried
- curious
- frustrated

and adjusts tone to provide encouragement or support.

 Error Handling
Handles unknown inputs gracefully by prompting the user to rephrase instead of crashing or becoming unresponsive.

 Code Optimization
- Uses dictionaries, lists, and string matching to efficiently handle logic.
- Fully contained in a single file (`Chatbot.cs`) for simplicity.
